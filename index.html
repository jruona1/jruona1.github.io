        <p>At this website, you will find workouts, technical videos, and advice for any event group you may be involved in. The goal of this website is to help student-athletes who suffer from poor coaching, something that affects far too many competitors from doing their best. I chose to create this website because I have heard a lot from teammates and athletes at other colleges and universities about their coaching in high school or in college, and how it wasnâ€™t/isn't up to the standard that they believed they deserved. If you find yourself to be in that position, this website will give you the help that you need, and it will help you reach your fullest potential. For athletes in high school, you have found this tool at the perfect time, as the effect of the website making you better could lead to different colleges and universities noticing you, which could change your life. </p>
